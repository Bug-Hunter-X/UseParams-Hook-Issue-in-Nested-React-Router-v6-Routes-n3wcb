This repository demonstrates a common issue and its solution when using the `useParams` hook with nested routes in React Router v6. The `bug.jsx` file shows the problem where `useParams` returns undefined when accessing a nested route directly. The `bugSolution.jsx` file shows the solution to this problem. The solution involves restructuring the routes to ensure that the parent route handles the parameters before passing them down to child routes.
